Place TCD/LCM loras here
Currently only stable diffusion 1.5 TCD/LCM loras can be used (because only stable diffusion 1.5 models can be used)

TCD LORA
curl -o tcd-sd15.safetensors -L https://huggingface.co/h1t/TCD-SD15-LoRA/resolve/main/pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors?download=true
LCM LORA
curl -o lcm-sd15.safetensors -L https://huggingface.co/latent-consistency/lcm-lora-sdv1-5/resolve/main/pytorch_lora_weights.safetensors?download=true

Make sure the tcd/lcm loras are placed here for them to work
They have to be named as tcd-sd15.safetensors and lcm-sd15.safetensors
